# CI Workflow

When the user asks to "run backend CI" or "run web CI", they mean:

- **Backend CI**: `scripts/ci-backend.sh` (lint, type-check, and pytest)
- **Web CI**: `scripts/ci-web.sh` (lint, type-check, and web tests)

Always run both before committing and pushing, unless the user specifies only one.
