# Context Governance Loop

When a discussion creates a stable, reusable project decision (not a one-off task):

- Promote it to durable sources in precedence order:
  1. `docs/agent-context/CONTEXT-shared.md`
  2. `docs/agent-context/**`
  3. `docs/decision-rationale/**`
  4. `docs/mvp-specification.md` (only if needed)
- Keep `docs/agent-context/**` as implementation contracts and `docs/decision-rationale/**` as rationale/guardrails.
- If the decision changes agent behavior across sessions, update `.cursor/rules/**` as well.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` aligned when a shared constraint or hard requirement changes.
- Update `docs/agent-context/ACTIVE-action-plan.md` when priorities/status change.
- Avoid churn: do not edit rules/docs for temporary or speculative decisions; only persist confirmed direction.
