# Context Documentation Sync

When editing architecture or implementation guidance:

- Keep `agent-context/**` focused on implementation contracts.
- Keep `decision-rationale/**` focused on why and guardrails.
- Preserve the shared context precedence documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Avoid introducing contradictions across `AGENTS.md`, context docs, and decision docs.
