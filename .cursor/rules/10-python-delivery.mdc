# Python Delivery Discipline

- Keep typing strict and explicit for service, ORM, and schema boundaries.
- Use explicit conversions between ORM models and API/domain schemas.
- Add or update tests for each implemented task.
- Keep business logic model-agnostic; route LLM selection through configuration.
- Never include secrets, personal identities, or raw sensitive identifiers in code or fixtures.
- Before committing and pushing, run `scripts/ci-backend.sh` locally to catch lint and test failures early. If it fails, fix the issues before committing.
