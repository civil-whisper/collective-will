# Emergent Rule Capture

While working through a sequence of actions, watch for repeating patterns that signal a latent convention — for example:

- The same fix applied in multiple places (code style, import order, error handling shape).
- A manual step the agent keeps performing (running a specific command, checking a specific file).
- A corrective loop where the agent or user reverts the same kind of mistake more than once.
- A structural choice that recurs across files (naming, directory placement, test layout).

When a pattern repeats **at least twice** and is not already covered by an existing rule in `.cursor/rules/`:

1. **Surface it** — tell the user: "I'm noticing a recurring pattern: *<one-line description>*. Want me to capture it as a Cursor rule?"
2. **On confirmation** — create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/` following the existing numbering and format conventions. Set `alwaysApply: true` for cross-cutting patterns, or scope with `globs` for file-specific ones.
3. **Keep it concise** — the rule should be under 50 lines with concrete examples where helpful.
4. **Skip noise** — do not propose rules for one-off fixes, user-specific preferences stated only once, or speculative ideas not yet confirmed by practice.
